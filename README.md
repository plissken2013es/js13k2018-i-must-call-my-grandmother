## Context

Cellphone's dead. No signal. An offline apocalypse!

And it seems that dead bodies are rising from their graves too.

If that's true, it's not the end of the world. Really, this could be a good chance to see again your gone and beloved Grandma. She could be walking the earth again.
You must find a phone booth and call her!

Based on Jesse Freeman's game concept and free sprite resources.
